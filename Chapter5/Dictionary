In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that allows you to store and manage data as key-value pairs. Dictionaries are unordered, mutable, and indexed by keys, which means you can add, remove, or modify items within them.

### Key Concepts:

- **Key**: The unique identifier for a value in the dictionary.
- **Value**: The data associated with a key.

### Creating a Dictionary:

You can create a dictionary by placing key-value pairs inside curly braces `{}`, separated by commas. Each key is followed by a colon `:` and its corresponding value.

```python
# Example of a simple dictionary
student = {
    "name": "Tanishq",
    "age": 21,
    "major": "Electronics and Computer Engineering"
}
```

### Accessing Values:

You can access values in a dictionary by referencing the key in square brackets `[]`.

```python
# Accessing the value of the 'name' key
print(student["name"])  # Output: Tanishq
```

### Adding or Modifying Items:

To add or modify a key-value pair in a dictionary, you can simply assign a value to a key.

```python
# Modifying the value of an existing key
student["age"] = 22

# Adding a new key-value pair
student["university"] = "XYZ University"
```

### Removing Items:

You can remove a key-value pair using the `del` statement or the `pop()` method.

```python
# Using del to remove a key-value pair
del student["major"]

# Using pop() to remove a key-value pair and return its value
age = student.pop("age")
```

### Looping Through a Dictionary:

You can loop through a dictionary to access keys, values, or both.

```python
# Looping through keys
for key in student:
    print(key)

# Looping through values
for value in student.values():
    print(value)

# Looping through key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### Dictionary Methods:

Python provides several methods for working with dictionaries:

- `keys()`: Returns a view object of the dictionary's keys.
- `values()`: Returns a view object of the dictionary's values.
- `items()`: Returns a view object of the dictionary's key-value pairs.
- `get(key, default)`: Returns the value for the specified key, or `default` if the key is not found.
- `update()`: Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or an iterable of key-value pairs.

### Example:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Tanishq",
    "age": 21,
    "major": "Electronics and Computer Engineering"
}

# Adding a new key-value pair
student["graduation_year"] = 2025

# Modifying an existing key-value pair
student["age"] = 22

# Removing a key-value pair
del student["major"]

# Looping through the dictionary
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

This will output:

```python
name: Tanishq
age: 22
graduation_year: 2025
```

Dictionaries are powerful for organizing and managing data where you need a fast lookup of values based on unique keys.
