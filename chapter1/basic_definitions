module :    it is basically a code that is written by somedbody else and can be used by any user by importing it in the required code.
            eg : codes of arithmetic mean, armstrong no etc (these are just examples....)

pip :       it is basically a file manager for python , we can use it to install modules in our program
            eg: ---->  flask(used for web app dev)
                ---->  django(development of secure websites)

command to use:  (similar to that of flutter)
---->   pip install flask 
---->   pip install pyjokes

TWO types of MODULE:
1. --- builtin module(preinstalled in python)
2. --- external module(needs installed in python using pip)
